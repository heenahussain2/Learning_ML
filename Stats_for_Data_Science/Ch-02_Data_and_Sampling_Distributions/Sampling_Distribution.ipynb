    "### Central Limit Theorem\n",
    "    -> The central limit theorem states that if you take sufficiently large random samples from the population (with replalcement), then the distribution of the sample means will be normally distributed or bell shaped.\n",
    "    -> This holds true even if the population is not normally distributed.\n",
    "    -> With respect to data science, the central limit theorem is not much used as hypothesis testing and confidence intervals play a small role in Datascience.\n",

    "    -> Standard scores are a great way to understand where a specific observation falls relative to the entire normal distribution\n",
    "    -> They also allow you to take observations drawn from normally distributed populations that have different means and standard deviations and place them on a standard scale.\n",
    "    ->  This standard scale enables you to compare observations that would otherwise be difficult.\n",
    "    -> This process is called standardization, and it allows you to compare observations and calculate probabilities across different populations.\n",
    "    -> To standardize your data, you need to convert the raw measurements into Z-scores.\n",
    "    -> After you standardize your data, you can place them within the standard normal distribution. \n",
    "    -> In this manner, standardization allows you to compare different types of observations based on where each observation falls within its own distribution. (ex: compare apple to oranges)\n",
