    "### Regression Notation (OLS)\n",
    "- The following notation for Ordinary Least Squares Regression (OLS) applies to a regression models for entire populations with k independent variables.\n",
    "- These are ideal models that you will obtain if you could measure the entire population.\n",
    "\n",
    "$Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + .... + \\beta_k X_k + \\epsilon$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notation:\n",
    "- Y represents the dependent variable\n",
    "- The beta ($\\beta$) represents the true population parameters. $\\beta_0$ is the constant while the other betas are for independent variables.\n",
    "- $X$'s are the independent variables.\n",
    "- Epsilon ($\\epsilon$) represents the error, which is the left-over random portion of variability that the model can't explain.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We never work with the entire population. Instead we use samples to estimate the population parameters. The notation for Regression model based on the sample is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\hat{y} = \\hat{\\beta_0} + \\hat{\\beta_1} X_1 + .... + \\hat{\\beta_k} X_k +\\hat{\\epsilon}$\n",

    "In this notation - The hats represents the sample estimates of the population values.\n",
    "- $\\hat{y}$ - represents the fittted value for the dependent variable. When we enter the values for the independent variable into the regression equation, we obtain the fitted value of the dependent variable.\n",
    "- $\\hat{\\beta}$ - the beta hats represent the estimates of population parameters. These estimates are the `regression coefficients` that appear in your output.\n",
    "- $\\hat{\\epsilon}$ - the epsilon hat represents the estimate of the error or what we call `residuals`."

    "- For ex we have two independent variables A and B:\n",
    "    - Both the variables are statistically significant, and the model provides a good fit for the data.\n",
    "    - In this scenario it can be concluded that the effect of variable A on the dependent variable(output) doesnot change due to change in values of variable B.\n",
    "    - Also variable A's effect is consistent throughout the range of values for A.\n",
    "    - The same applies to the effect of variable B - It doesnot depend on A, and it remains consistent.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Coefficients and p values in regression analysis helps to understand which relationships in the model are statistically significant and the nature of those relationships.\n",
    "- The coefficients represent a variable's effect and describe the magnitude and direction of the relationship between each independent variable.\n",
    "- Coefficients are numbers in the regression equation that multiply the values of the variables(slope or m).\n",
    "- The p-values for the coefficients indicate whether these relationships are statistically significant.\n",
    "- The sign of a regression coefficient tells whether the value of dependent variable increases or decreases with change in each independent variable. In other words +ve coefficient means as the value of independent variable increases, the mean for the dependent variables also increases.\n",
    "- A -ve coeffcient means a decrease in mean of independent variable with the increase in value of the dependent variable(inverse relationship).\n",

    "### Interpreting p-values for Continuous Independent Variables\n",
    "- Regression Analysis is a form of inferential statistics, where we use a sample to draw conclusions about an entire population.\n",
    "- Sample errors can produce effects in the sample that don't exist in the population.\n",
    "- p-values and significance levels help determine whether the observed relationship in the sample also exist in the larger population.\n",
    "- The p-value for each independent variable tests the null hypothesis that there is no relationship with the dependent variable.\n",
    "- If there is no relationship, then there is no association between the changes in the independent variable and the shifts in the dependent variable.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- The hypothesis for the independent variables are following:  \n",
    "    - **Null Hypothesis** - The coefficient for the independent variable equals zero (there is no relationship) or (p-value > significance level)  \n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Alternative Hypothesis**  - The coefficient for the independent variable doesnot equal zero (there is a relationship) or (p-value < significance level)\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the `p-value` for a variable is less than the significance level, the sample data provides enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis for the entire population.\n",
    "- This means changes in the independent variable are associated with the changes in response at the population level.\n",
    "- The variable is statistically significant and can be included in the regression model. Significance level of 0.05 are the most common value.\n",

    "- Recoding involves taking original values and mathematically converting them to other values.\n",
    "- While the recoding methods can cause you to interpret some of the results differently, the p-values and goodness-of-fit measures will remmain the same when you fit the same model.\n",

    "#### Standardizing the Continuous Variables\n",
    "- To standardize a variable:\n",
    "    - Take each observed value for a variable.\n",
    "    - Subtract the variable's mean.\n",
    "    - Then divide by the variable's standard deviation.\n",
    "- When we standardize a variable, the coded value denotes where the observation falls in the distribution of values.\n",
    "- It indicates the number of standard deviation above or below the variable's mean.\n",
    "- The sign indicates whether the observations are above or below the mean and the number indicates thr number of standard deviations.\n",
    "- Standardized values of 0 indicates that the value is precisely equal to the mean.\n",

    "#### Interpreting Standardized Coefficients\n",

    "- Standardized coefficients signify the mean change of the dependent variable given a one standard deviation increase in an independent variable.\n",

    "#### Why obtain Standardized Coefficients?\n",
    "- Standardization puts all the variables on the same scale so we can compare the magnitude of the results.\n",
    "- It is used when independent variables have entirely different units like temp(C) and thickness(cm) or it doesn't have any specified units at all like a scale(from 1 to ..).\n",
    "- Standardization puts all the variables on a consistant scale, which allows us to compare the standardized coefficients."
